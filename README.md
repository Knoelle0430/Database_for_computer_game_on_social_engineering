Welcome to the Database_for_computer_game_on_social_engineering project

To run this code first you will need to make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/connect-python-with-sql/ - This tutorial can help setup MySQL on your machine

Next download the Python notebook from this repository.

Open the Python notebook in an IDE that supports running .ipynb files like Jupyter Notebook.

Next you will need to modify block 3 of the code to match your credentials for MySQL.

If it's the first time running the code, all blocks can be run. However, every other time running the code the blocks that contain the functions, the block that selects all questions from the quiz, and the block that contains the GUI are the only ones that should be run. The states blocks are In 1, In 2, In 3, In 7, In 9, In 11, In 13, In 21, and In 28. Running In 17 can be run but isn't required for the code to function. In 65 might cause duplicate questions. In 39 will cause an error as the database already exsists. In 41 will cause an error as the tables already exist in the database. When In 39, In 41, and In 65 are run, the success message must appear before continuing. In 21 must be run before running In 28 and the "MySQL Database connection successful" message must appear before proceding. Each block should be run in the order they appear.

If all is successful, you should see the GUI popup for the home screen of the game. After that the game provides most instructions. 

When any choices are provided, they must be clicked as enter will not work.
